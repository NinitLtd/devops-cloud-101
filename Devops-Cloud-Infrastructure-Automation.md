# :DevOps and Cloud Engineer - Essentials:
### {Infrastructure as Code (IaC) / software defined infrastructure (SDI)}
**Learn from experienced and  certified professionals**

### Aim:
> This course is designed for those individuals and/or groups who are interested in learning modern ways of provisioning Infrastructure resources such as virtual servers, containers, databases,  data stores (storage), firewalls, virtual private clouds, virtual private networks, subnets, kubernetes resources,  etc. On completion of this course, participants will gain hands-on experience on preparing / writing code to build datacenter(s) from scratch. You will be able to provision and manage global infrastructure while working comfortably from any remote location.

> Participants will become confident around concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes. This course is for anyone who is interested in improving their employment chances for highly paid jobs with a long term stable career.
